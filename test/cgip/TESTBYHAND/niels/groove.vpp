Class Groove

The Groove class pattern defines classes representing welding grooves. Class Groove is a virtuel container class defining the operations available on grooves.
The Groove classes are used in two ways:
 1) To create the welding groove from the RST points and the QRV vector.
 2) To be continuesly ???reduced??? while creating welding layers from the groove. For this second use internal parameters will be updated and the consistence of parameters of the newly create groove may disappear.
The container class Groove maintains a parameter, empty, used to describe whether the groove is empty or not. This is used for 2).

Class TJointGroove

The class TJointGroove is a concrete realisation of the class Groove. It represents the grooves of type T-Joint.
It maintains two kinds of instance variables:
 1) variables that define the groove and that are copied when copying an object. These are:
   - R1, S1, T1, R2, S2, T2: The RST points, of class Point2.
   - epsilon: The ???groove surface angle???, of type Angle,
     Af, Ab, Ar: ???the three areas???, of type Area,
     LenLength: ???what???, of type Length,
     WeldSize: ???welding size???, og type lenght,
     These are the QRV parameters.
   - A1, A2, B1, C1, C2, D1, D2: The corners of Ar and Ab, of class Point2.
   - empty: the empty flag, of type bool,
     jointtype: the type of the joint, of type TJointType (either <TJoint> or <SharpTJoint>).
     Internal variables
 2) temporare variables that are only defined to make the computations (both creation and extraction of layers) easier (and more imperative), but also copied when copying an object of class TJointGroove. These are
   - ls2: the line describing the surface of Plate2 (created from the points ???R2 and S2???),
     lAr: the line describing the surface of the groove (connecting A1 and A2), both of class Line2
 3) temporare variables that are only defined to make the computations (both creation and extraction of layers) easier (and more imperative), not copied when copying an object of class TJointGroove. These are
   - variables used while creating the groove:
     E2, F2, G, H, P, of class Point2,
     ls2, lt1, lPl1c, lAb, lAdep, of class Line2,
     a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, of class Vector2,
     Ag, Atj, of type Area,
   - variables used while extracting layers:
     A1B1seg, B1C1seg, Sideseg, of class LineSegment2,
     GhB, GhT, of class Point2,
     Gh, of class Vector2.
The type TJointType is a union type describing the two different kinds of TJoint groove: 
 1) TJoint: where both Plate1 and Plate2 are straight lines
 2) SharpTJoint: where Plate1 is sharpend in the point S1.

Operation: restrictByHeight
Arguments: A height, layerh, and a sequence of object (references), lcrit, of class LayerCriteria.
Results: An object (reference) of type LayerCriteria and an Error.
Action: Creates a object of class LayerCriteria of height layerh starting from the bottom of the current groove and redraws its area from the groove.
This strategy is only based on the maximum layer height.
