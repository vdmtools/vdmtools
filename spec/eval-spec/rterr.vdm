  ErrorValTp(err, semval, type, txts) ==
    return mk_SEM`ValTp(ErrorVal(err, semval, type, txts), nil);

  ErrorVal: ERR * [SEM`VAL] * [AS`Type] * seq of seq of char ==>

The $ErrorVal$ operation is only needed to ensure that no type errors
are reported from the places where the error is produced where a value
should be produced. The value will in reality never be returned!

\begin{vdm_al}
  Error: ERR * [SEM`VAL] * [AS`Type] * seq of seq of char ==> ()
  Error(err, semval, type, txts) ==
    def err' = Num2Str(err) ^ ": " ^ UTIL`ReplacePercent(GetErrorMessage(err), txts)
    in
      (SetError("Run-Time Error " ^ err', semval, type, txts);
       def - = IO`fwriteval[seq of char]("rterr.msg", GetError(), <start>)
       --in error;
       in STKM`ThrowRuntimeErrorException();
      );
\end{vdm_al}

The $InitError$ operation is meant to be used for errors which are to
be reported in the initialisation phase (i.e. before the state machine
evaluation has really started).

\begin{vdm_al}
  InitError: ERR * CI`ContextId * seq of seq of char ==> ()

     if cid = CI`NilContextId
     then posmsg := "Unknown position\n"
     else def mk_(-, -, -, tokenpos, -) = CI`GetFilePos(cid);
              mk_CI`TokenPos(-, abs_line, -, -, column) = tokenpos;
              line = Num2Str(abs_line);
              column_s = Num2Str(column) 
           in posmsg := "Line " ^ line ^ " column " ^ column_s ^ "\n";
     errmsg := posmsg ^ "Run-Time Error " ^ err';
     def - = IO`fwriteval[seq of char]("rterr.msg", GetError(), <start>)
     in 
       error;
    );

  SetError: ERRSTR * [SEM`VAL] * [AS`Type] * seq of seq of char ==> ()
  SetError(err,-,-,-) ==
    (
     def cid = STKM`GetCurCid()
     in
       if cid = CI`NilContextId
       then errmsg := "Command line error \n"
       else def mk_(-, -, -, tokenpos, -) = CI`GetFilePos(cid);
                mk_CI`TokenPos(-, abs_line, -, -, column) = tokenpos;
                line = Num2Str(abs_line);
                column_s = Num2Str(column) 
            in
              errmsg := "Line " ^ line ^ " column " ^ column_s ^ "\n";
     errmsg := errmsg ^ err;
     );
